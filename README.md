# Mac-OS Dev setup

For Macos, best tiling windows manager is `yabai` and `skhd`. The configuration options for both are present in the respective folders. The config options should be put in the location `~/.config/`.

The `Brewfile` contains the applications and the command line dev tools which have been installed using `homebrew`. This has been generated by running the command - 

```
brew bundle dump --describe
```
