Keeping track of the dotfiles which I use.

# Additional Information

# Mac-OS Dev setup

For Macos, best tiling windows manager is `yabai` and `skhd`. The configuration options for both are present in the respective folders. The config options should be put in the location `~/.config/`.

The `Brewfile` contains the applications and the command line dev tools which have been installed using `homebrew`. This has been generated by running the command - 

```
brew bundle dump --describe
```

# Enabling and disabling tiling
Tiling is important anytime you want to have multiple windows open on the screen at the same time, which helps in various applications such as coding, scientific research et cetera.

If anytime you want to turn off tiling window manager which in this case is Yabai, you need to run the following command to stop the yabai service - 

```
yabai --stop-service
```
and to restart yabai you can use the command `yabai --start-service`. `man yabai` will givea good description about how to interact with yabai.
